# Distributing module for different platforms

You should refer the adapter module in submodule under this directory, to build the distriction for a specified chain-platform.

e.g:

Under hyfabric we refer the module of *hyperledger.abchain.org/adapter/hyfabric* so we can build the corresponding chaincode and sdk working with hyperledger-fabric 1.4
